# Project React Native App ðŸ“±

In this week's project at the Technigo boot camp our task was to build our first mobile application with React Native.
Our only restrictions were that the project should be a mobile app created with React Native and using styled components.

Tech:
<br>React Native, CSS (styled components)</br>

I chose to create a movie quiz app with five questions (multiple-choice with four alternatives answers for each question).
I created a button for each answer-alternative and created functions for the right and wrong answers. I also created a variable called "score" that was initially set to zero and that would increase with 1 for each right answer. I created a start-button, next-button and a restart button (at the end of the quiz).
